# Hackathon in Lille on September 2021

## Description

CRIStAL research center, University of Lille, hosts the SPEED project hackathon on September 2021 at Polytech Lille school. 
Website of SPEED project: https://www.smartportsecosystem.com/ 

## Rules 

Each team must: 
- choose a name for the team and select at least one challenge to solve 
- present the proposed technology in a 20 minutes pitch on the second day
- release the data and codes on github under a free license like MIT or BSD

The evaluation criteria will be based on the innovative characteristics of the solution, the relevance of the technology regarding the ease of industrialization and the performance of the algorithms. Finally, the disruptive part (database enrichment, new AI frameworks, extension of source codes given as example,...) of the technology and of the pitch will be evaluated too. 

**To help you, we provide a [guideline](SPEED_Guideline_for_presenting_the_hackaton_results.pdf) to write your pitch.**
